2.  **Terminal Emulator (e.g., Termux for Android):**
    * **Why:** For fundamental file system navigation (`cd`, `ls`), directory creation (`mkdir`), basic file editing (`nano`), and potentially running simple local web servers for testing.
    * **Action:** If you haven't already, install Termux (Android). We'll cover basic commands in the next lesson.
3.  **No-Code Platform (e.g., Framer, Webflow):**
    * **Why:** For visually building professional, responsive websites without writing code. Their mobile browser interfaces are robust.
    * **Action:** Sign up for free accounts on Framer and Webflow and start exploring their mobile dashboards.
4.  **Online Code Editor / Sandbox (e.g., CodePen, JSFiddle, Replit):**
    * **Why:** For quickly testing AI-generated code snippets, experimenting with HTML/CSS/JS, or sharing small code examples. Runs in your mobile browser.
