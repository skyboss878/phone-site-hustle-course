Welcome, Phone Site Hustlers, to Module 3! You’ve already unleashed the power of AI to generate custom code. Now, prepare to add another powerful arrow to your quiver: **the No-Code Revolution.**

What if I told you there's a way to build incredibly polished, professional websites without touching a single line of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript? Even though you now have an AI partner for coding, sometimes the fastest way to get a visually stunning site live is with a no-code platform.

**No-code tools are visual website builders that allow you to drag, drop, and configure elements to create a site. Think of it like building with digital Lego blocks.**

Why are we diving into no-code when we have a secret AI weapon?
* **Blazing Speed:** For certain types of websites (like portfolios, simple landing pages, or marketing sites), no-code can be even faster for initial setup and design.
* **Visual Design Focus:** If your strength is visual layout, no-code platforms allow you to design intuitively without getting bogged down in syntax.
* **Client Preferences:** Some clients might prefer or request a site built on a popular no-code platform, and you’ll now be equipped to deliver!
* **Complementary Power:** The best part? Your AI secret weapon can *enhance* your no-code workflow. Need a unique CSS snippet for a no-code element? Ask Gemini! Want custom JavaScript functionality that the no-code platform doesn't offer? Gemini can write it, and you can often inject it. This is where your combined superpowers truly shine!

In this module, we'll focus on two leading no-code platforms that are genuinely mobile-friendly and powerful: **Framer** and **Webflow**. While they have subtle differences, the core principles of visual building are similar across both.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
* Understand the core philosophy of no-code web development.
* Navigate and utilize the essential features of a no-code builder on your phone.
* Rapidly prototype and build beautiful web pages without writing a single line of code.

Get ready to sculpt websites with your fingertips!
