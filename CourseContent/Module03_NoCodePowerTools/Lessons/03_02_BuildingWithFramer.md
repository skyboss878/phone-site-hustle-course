Welcome back, Phone Site Hustlers! In our last lesson, we explored the philosophy of the No-Code Revolution. Now, it's time to get our hands dirty and build your first stunning, no-code website using **Framer**.

Framer is an incredibly powerful, yet intuitive, tool that lets you design and publish professional websites visually. You can create complex layouts, add smooth animations, and even integrate dynamic content, all without writing a single line of code. It's often compared to design tools like Figma but with the added power of *publishing live websites*.

While Framer's full design studio is primarily desktop-based for complex projects, its collaborative and preview features are excellent on mobile, and the core concepts you'll learn translate perfectly to quick on-the-go edits or client showcases from your phone.

### **Getting Started with Framer:**

1.  **Sign Up & Log In:**
    * **Action:** Go to `framer.com` on your browser (desktop or mobile) and sign up for a free account. Log in to your dashboard.
    * **Note:** For building, we'll recommend a desktop for the main design phase, but emphasize that reviewing, presenting, and even minor text edits are perfect for mobile.

### **Framer Fundamentals: Your Digital Building Blocks**

Let's quickly understand the core concepts in Framer that let you build so efficiently:

* **Frames:** These are your containers. Think of them like empty boxes where you put content (text, images, other frames). Every element lives inside a frame.
    **[VISUAL: Simple graphic showing a frame as a box.]**
* **Stacks:** A powerful type of frame that automatically arranges its child elements horizontally or vertically. This is key for responsive design!
    **[VISUAL: Graphic showing elements neatly stacking.]**
* **Components:** Reusable building blocks. Design a button or a navigation bar once, save it as a component, and use it everywhere. Edit it once, and it updates everywhere!
    **[VISUAL: Graphic showing one component being updated and all instances changing.]**
* **Text & Media:** Add headlines, paragraphs, images, videos, and more.
* **Styles Panel:** This is where you control everything visual â€“ colors, fonts, spacing, shadows, borders, effects.

### **Step-by-Step Build: A Simple Business Card Website**

Let's build a one-page "digital business card" site for a hypothetical freelancer. This is a common and quick client win for Phone Site Hustlers!

#### **Goal:** A single page with:
* A **Hero Section**: Name, Title, and a "Contact Me" button.
* An **About Section**: Short bio.
* A **Contact Section**: Email address and phone number.

**[VIDEO TUTORIAL: Walkthrough of each step below, focusing on the Framer interface.]**

1.  **Set Up the Canvas:**
    * Ensure your main canvas is set to a desktop breakpoint (e.g., 1200px wide).
    * **Action:** Delete any default elements on the canvas to start fresh.

2.  **Create the Hero Section:**
    * Draw a **Frame** across the top of the canvas (e.g., 1200x400px).
    * Add **Text** layers inside: Your Name (H1), Your Title (H2).
    * Add a **Button** component. Label it "Contact Me."
    * Style the frame (background color/image), text (fonts, colors), and button (colors, rounded corners).
    * **Action:** Group these elements within the frame for organization.

3.  **Add the About Section:**
    * Draw another **Frame** below the hero section.
    * Add a **Text** layer for the heading "About Me" (H2).
    * Add another **Text** layer for a short bio (P).
    * Style it with a contrasting background color.

4.  **Create the Contact Section:**
    * Draw a final **Frame** below the About section.
    * Add a **Text** layer for the heading "Get In Touch" (H2).
    * Add **Text** layers for a dummy email (e.g., `you@email.com`) and phone number (e.g., `(555) 123-4567`).
    * Style with a distinct background.

5.  **Basic Responsiveness (Stacks & Layout):**
    * Select your main content frames.
    * Convert them into a **Stack** (vertical stack). Framer will automatically manage spacing.
    * Adjust padding on the stack to give content breathing room.
    * Switch to the mobile breakpoint (e.g., 390px wide) and observe how Framer automatically adjusts. Make minor tweaks if necessary for mobile view.
    * **Action:** Practice switching between desktop and mobile views.

6.  **Publish Your Site!**
    * Locate the **"Publish"** button in the top right corner.
    * Click "Publish." Framer will provide a live URL!
    * **Action:** Open this URL on your phone's browser to see your live, no-code website!
    **[SCREENSHOT/SHORT VIDEO CLIP: Show the publish button and then the live site URL opening on a phone.]**
