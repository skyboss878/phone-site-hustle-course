### **Pricing Your Services: Value Over Hours**

Forget charging by the hour. As a Phone Site Hustler with AI and no-code tools, you build *fast*. Charging hourly would undersell your efficiency and expertise. Instead, we focus on **value-based pricing**.

**What is Value-Based Pricing?**
It means you charge based on the *results* or *value* your service brings to the client, not the time it takes you. A website could bring a client thousands in new business; your fee should reflect that potential.

**How to Determine Your Price (The Phone Site Formula):**

1.  **Understand the Client's ROI (Return on Investment):** How much could a new website potentially make or save them?
    * *Example:* A local plumber might get 5 new leads a month from a good website, and each lead is worth $200. That's $1,000/month in potential new business. If your site helps them get even 1-2 new leads, it's already paying for itself.
2.  **Your "Desired Hourly Rate" (for internal calculation only):** Even though you don't charge hourly, have an internal rate (e.g., $50-$100/hour). Estimate how many *realistically focused* hours a project might take you (not including AI generation time). Use this as a *floor*, not a ceiling.
3.  **The "Market Rate" for a Simple Site:** Research what basic websites typically cost from traditional agencies (often $1,500 - $5,000+). You can offer something highly competitive yet still very profitable.

**Typical Phone Site Hustle Price Range for a Simple Site:**
* **$500 - $1,500+ for a basic 1-5 page "brochure" website or landing page.**
* **$1,500 - $3,000+ for sites with more features** like basic e-commerce integration, a blog (Webflow CMS!), or advanced forms.

**Rule of Thumb:** Your price should feel a *little* bit uncomfortable to say out loud at first. That usually means it's about right. Remember, you're delivering professional results, fast.
