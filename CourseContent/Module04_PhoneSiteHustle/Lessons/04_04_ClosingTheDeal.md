### **The Phone Site Hustle Sales Process**

1.  **The Discovery Call/Meeting:**
    * **Purpose:** To understand their needs, pain points, and goals. This is *not* a sales pitch yet; it's an information-gathering session.
    * **Your Role:** Listen more than you speak. Ask open-ended questions (e.g., "What are your biggest challenges right now?", "How do you envision a new website helping your business?").
    * **Key Outcome:** Identify if they are a good fit for your services and if you can genuinely help them.
    * **Action:** Practice a few key discovery questions.

2.  **Crafting Your Proposal:**
    * Based on the discovery call, create a simple, clear proposal.
    * **What to include:**
        * **Problem Statement:** Briefly reiterate their pain points.
        * **Your Solution:** Explain how your Phone Site Hustle service solves their problem.
        * **Deliverables:** What exactly will you build/provide (e.g., "A 3-page responsive website," "Basic SEO setup," "2 rounds of revisions").
        * **Timeline:** A realistic timeframe for project completion.
        * **Investment:** Your price. Be clear and confident.
        * **Call to Action:** What's the next step (e.g., "Sign contract," "Schedule follow-up call").
    * **Tools:** You can use simple document apps on your phone or free online proposal templates. Keep it concise.
    * **Action:** Draft a template proposal for your basic offering.

3.  **Presenting & Negotiating:**
    * **Presentation:** Walk them through the proposal, focusing on how it benefits *them*. Address any concerns.
    * **Handling Objections:**
        * **"It's too expensive!"** Reiterate value. "I understand, but consider the potential increase in leads/sales this website could bring." Or offer a stripped-down version.
        * **"I need to think about it."** "Absolutely. What specific concerns do you have that I can address now?"
    * **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate slightly, but don't undervalue your work. Know your minimum viable price.
    * **Action:** Role-play handling common objections with a friend.

4.  **The Agreement/Contract:**
    * **Crucial!** A simple written agreement protects both parties.
    * **What to include:** Project scope, payment terms (e.g., 50% upfront, 50% upon completion), revision limits, timeline, ownership of assets.
    * **Tools:** You can find free basic contract templates online (search "freelance web design contract template"). Use a mobile-friendly e-signature tool if possible.
    * **Action:** Find and adapt a simple contract template.

### **Payment & Onboarding**

* **Payment First:** Always get at least 50% payment upfront before starting any work. This shows commitment from the client and protects your time.
* **Onboarding:** Once the contract is signed and payment received, this is your transition to project mode.
    * Send a welcome email.
    * Request necessary assets (logos, content, images).
    * Set clear communication expectations (e.g., "I'll provide updates every Tuesday").
    * **Action:** Create a checklist for your client onboarding process.
